    <h2>Bouldering Basics</h2>
    <p>
      Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is meant to be done on small (relative to cliff faces and mountains) rock formations and/or artificial rock walls like the ones we have in our gym. 
      Bouldering is inherently a dangerous sport that <strong>does NOT</strong> involve the use of any ropes or harnesses.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bouldering routes are typically 15–20 feet high. Our walls are 13 feet tall on average.</li>
      <li>Crash pads are used for safety. All walls in our gym have pads installed beneath them.</li>
      <li>Climbing shoes and chalk provide grip and hygiene. We use liquid chalk and chalk socks only—<strong>no loose or block chalk allowed</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bouldering Etiquette</h2>
    <h3>Safety First:</h3>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Spotting:</strong> Only spot when needed to prevent injury (e.g., avoiding walls or pad misses).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Climbing in a Shared Space:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wait your turn if someone is climbing near your route.</li>
